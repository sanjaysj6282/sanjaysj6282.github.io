I am currently an MS by Research at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), working under the guidance of Prof. [Charu Sharma](https://charusharma.org/) at the [Machine Learning Lab (MLL)](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/). My research lies at the intersection of 3D computer vision and deep generative modeling, with a focus on point cloud representation learning, diffusion models for anomaly detection, and geometry-aware neural architectures.

Prior to this, I interned at MLL with Prof. Charu Sharma, where I explored knowledge distillation for 3D models — this work led to a publication at _WACV_ 2025. I also interned with Prof. [Ramanathan Muthuganapathy](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) at the [Advanced Geometric Computing Lab (AGCL)](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html), IIT Madras, working on deep learning for 2D CAD sketch reconstruction, which resulted in a publication at _Computers & Graphics_.

My technical strengths include building lightweight and efficient deep learning pipelines for 3D tasks. I’m also passionate about optimizing neural rendering techniques like NeRF for speed and memory efficiency.

Outside of research, I enjoy solving real-world problems through full-stack product development, participating in hackathons, and mentoring junior students through community activities.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
