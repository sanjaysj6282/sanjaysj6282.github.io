I am currently an MS by Research student in the CSE Department at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), working under the guidance of Prof. [Charu Sharma](https://charusharma.org/) in the domain of 3D computer vision and deep generative modeling. My research broadly focuses on point cloud representation learning, diffusion models for anomaly detection, and geometry-aware neural architectures for 3D understanding.

Previously, I interned with Prof. [Ramanathan Muthuganapathy](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/) at the [Advanced Geometric Computing Lab (AGCL)](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~raman/agcl/agcl.html), IIT Madras, where I worked on deep learning frameworks for 2D CAD sketch reconstruction, culminating in a publication at _Computers & Graphics_. I have also worked at the [Machine Learning Lab (MLL)](https://mll.iiit.ac.in/), IIIT Hyderabad, exploring knowledge distillation for 3D models, leading to a publication at _WACV_ 2025.

My technical strengths include building lightweight and efficient deep learning pipelines for point cloud-based classification, reconstruction, and anomaly detection tasks. I’m also passionate about optimizing neural rendering techniques like NeRF for speed and memory efficiency.

Outside of research, I enjoy solving real-world problems through full-stack product development, participating in hackathons, and mentoring junior students through community activities.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
