    abstract={The significant improvements in point cloud representation learning have increased its applicability in many real-life applications, resulting in the need for lightweight, better-performing models. One widely proposed efficient method is knowledge distillation, where a lightweight model uses knowledge from large models. Very few works exist on distilling the knowledge for point clouds. Most of the work focuses on cross-modal-based approaches that make the method expensive to train. This paper proposes PointKAD, an adversarial knowledge distillation framework for point cloud-based tasks. PointKAD includes adversarial feature distillation and response distillation with the help of discriminators to extract and distill the representation of feature maps and logits. We conduct extensive experimental studies on both synthetic (ModelNet40) and real (ScanObjectNN) datasets to show that PointKAD achieves state-of-the-art results compared to the existing knowledge distillation methods for point cloud classification. Additionally, we present results on the part segmentation task, highlighting the efficacy of the PointKAD framework. Our experiments further reveal that PointKAD is capable of transferring knowledge across different tasks and datasets, showcasing its versatility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PointKAD can be applied to a cross-modal training setup, achieving competitive performance with cross-modal-based point cloud methods for classification.}

    abstract = {Retrieval systems are commonly used to find relevant data in large datasets. In engineering, these systems are useful for locating specific engineering shapes in a large dataset of engineering components. When end users want to search for a shape, they prefer a two-dimensional (2D) sketch over a three-dimensional (3D) object. However, users lacking domain knowledge may struggle to generate a complete query sketch and provide a partially completed sketch instead. Retrieving relevant information from partially drawn sketches is difficult because they may have missing edges, partially drawn circles, holes, ovals, etc. Most retrieval systems compare the similarity between the query and items in the database, so incomplete sketches may be ineffective in finding the relevant information. To address this problem with incomplete sketches, we propose a new generative adversarial network called SketchCADGAN. This network uses a two-stage cascaded architecture, with the first network attempting to predict a CAD model image from an incomplete sketch and the second network using the CAD model image to predict a completed sketch. Both networks are trained together adversarially. Our approach is proven more effective than other advanced techniques through qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Furthermore, we present the results of the retrieval system using both partially drawn and completed sketches, and demonstrate that incorporating completed sketches from the suggested cascaded GAN architecture results in improved retrieval performance.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
